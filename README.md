# midi-sequencer

This is an experiment to try and improve the classic "piano roll" found in most music software.
The idea is as you place notes the UI suggests notes that would sound good with what's already written by changing the background color, making it easier to discover interesting sounds.

There's a precompiled executable for Windows 64bit in the "release" folder, along with everything else needed to run.
